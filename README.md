## About

Tasko is a company that helps you manage your tasks efficiently by using kanban boards. Kanban boards are a visual way of organizing your work into different stages, such as to-do, in progress, and done. With Tasko, you can create and customize your own kanban boards, add tasks, and collaborate with your team members. Tasko is designed to be simple, intuitive, and flexible, so you can focus on getting things done and achieving your goals.

## Documentation

Currently, there is no documentation or wiki available but, I do plan to add one in the future on the main site.
